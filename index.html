                  The story of Ghost goes back to Louisville, KY in 2014. 
                  Not having had a cat since I left home in 2009, I was finally 
                  in an apartment and wanted a fluffy compatriot to keep me company. 
                  There were a bunch of cats living in the garage belonging to a friend's 
                  parents and they let me come over and have my pick of their semi-feral 
                  freeloaders. I immediately saw a gorgeous fluffy little baby and had 
                  to have him.  
               </p>
               <p>
                  Now Ghost came by his name honestly. He was technically named after a 
                  direwolf in Game of Thrones for his lupine looks, but decided to go method.
                  First, I couldn't have him right away. When he realized he was chosen for 
                  <strike>the Hunger Games</strike> indoor living, he fled to a recess of the 
                  garage not to be seen for days. Fortunately, my friend's dad finally caught 
                  him, but unfortunately, when he was released from bathroom quarantine, 
                  he managed to vanish yet again only this time in my two bedroom apartment.
               </p>
               <p>
                  I would hear him eating and dash into the kitchen to catch him in the act, 
                  but he was nowhere to be found. After an organized stakeout where he ran 
                  from me and my love, I finally saw his body dipping into a cabinet. Not an 
                  actual accessible cabinet mind you. The corner where the cabinets met. He 
                  had managed to find a small hole in the baseboard and had crawled inside the 
                  body of the cabinet. It was the ultimate hiding spot. He was smart, but I was 
                  smarter so I stuffed it with newspaper so he couldn't elude me again.
               </p>
               <p>
                  I'm happy to say that these days he is a needy, loving little toddler who will 
                  lay on your head and fling your belongings on the floor if you're not paying 
                  enough attention to him. He's full of personality and has been described as 
                  looking like he "knows things," which could be unsettling, I suppose. But mostly, 
                  he's my baby and he's finally as obsessed with me as I was with him back in 2014.

                  Balthazar is what one would call, not just a "good boy,"
                  but the "goodest boy." He is a sweet, meaty little baby with no concept of his own
                  strength. He has black scythes for nails that he seemingly never learned to control 
                  and panics if you try to pick him up. So unless you're looking to collect on your 
                  Accidental Death and Dismemberment insurance and finally get some use out of it, I 
                  don't recommend trying.

                  He and Sheba are both a breed of cat called Bengals. My fiancé is allergic to cats, 
                  but was understandably committed to having them anyway. Bengals are supposed to be hypoallergenic
                  so he ponied up $1,500 for this very pointy, not so cuddly, but verrry handsome feline. 
                  The joke was on him since I was a package deal with the aforementioned "Fluff Butt." 
                  But it's nothing a Claritin a day won't fix.

               <p>
                  After many band-aids and scars, we have finally gotten to the point that, if you hold him juuust 
                  right, you can enjoy all 22 pounds of him in your arms for 5 seconds. He will climb in your lap 
                  and stay if you DO NOT TOUCH HIM. He will also yell in that characteristically Bengal way when he's 
                  feeling a little needy. (The neediness is a trend. Cats are supposed to be aloof, but we got all 
                  the ones that need our attention <i>constantly</i>.) If you smack his butt long enough, he gets 
                  what we fondly call tater tail where it puffs up and turns into a pipecleaner. Watch out for the cute agression, 
                  though! If he is pet too long, the affection becomes overwhelming. His eyes blow out and he attacks 
                  the cat tree with abandon.

                  Even without being told, anyone could guess that Sheba began life as an only child. She came to us from 
                  an older couple who were having some health issues and felt like they couldn't give her the attention she 
                  needed. When we got ready to take her with us, they kept unloading closet's worth of fancy cat food like real, 
                  individually-packaged chicken strips and actual toys instead of the box their Amazon package came in earlier. 
                  They didn't have any children so all of that DINK income was going toward the princess.
               </p>
               <p>
                  She wasn't used to not having subjects and immediately attached herself to my fiancé. The only problem was 
                  that she had to share him with me and she did not like it. It took her some time to come around, but now we 
                  enjoy a classic love-hate relationship (More love than hate, but I do love to talk smack about her).
               </p>   
               <p>
                  She is unendingly coy and will cry if you hold her for too long, but if you put her down she will immediately 
                  look at you as though you have personally wounded her. She likes to run into walls and flop on the floor if 
                  you just glance at her, but give her too much attention, and she will lash out. She is truly a master of manipulation. 
                  She has <strike>one</strike> <strike>two</strike> three weaknesses, though: my fiancé, chimken, and her belly. 
                  She has this odd habit where she likes to suck on her belly and will always try to do so if you hold her like a 
                  baby. Just today, the man she adores so ardently called her a "nip nop-sucking trash goblin&reg;." And yet, she takes 
                  these insults in stride and pretends to be better than me anyway.
